## What does the script do?
Well, as the name suggests, this simple Python script uses Python's turtle module to generate spot paintings like Damien's based on the palette of an image chosen by you, so you can also sell your works of art and become a millionaire. <br>
Here's an example of a spot painting generated by this script: </br>
